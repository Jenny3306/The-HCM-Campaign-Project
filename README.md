## 📘 Programming Fundamentals - The HCM Campaign Project

This assignment is a large-scale C++ project for the **Programming Fundamentals** course, designed to help students apply core programming concepts in a meaningful and structured way.

### 🎯 Objective

Students are tasked with simulating the **Ho Chi Minh Campaign**, the final phase of the historic Spring 1975 General Offensive and Uprising, in celebration of its 50th anniversary. The project is a reenactment through **Object-Oriented Programming**, where students design and implement classes to represent military units, battlefield elements, and combat mechanics.

### 🛠 Key Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Function and function calls
- File Input/Output
- Dynamic memory allocation and pointers
- Singly linked lists

### ⚔️ Context

Through this assignment, students will build a battle simulation between two armies — **Liberation Army** and **ARVN** — based on structured class design and game-like logic. The project not only strengthens technical programming skills but also connects students with an important moment in Vietnam's history.
